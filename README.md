# Python Testing with pytest

Practice exercises from the book **Python Testing with pytest: Simple, Rapid, Effective, and Scalable**

From it from [this link](https://amzn.to/3DIYPwN) and I get a commission.

## Setup and Run tests

I am using `pipenv` to manage my virtual environment. Install it via `pip`: 

    pip3 install pipenv

Then do to get necessary things setup:

    pipenv install

Finally run the tests:

    pytest
